  "body": "## Project Description & Motivation\r\nOur scene is a VR experience taking place in a modern suburban-style home. The user is given cleaning tasks, or chores, to complete which will have an effect on the future acceleration later in the scene. While doing these chores, the user must make energy-conscious decisions such as whether to use high-energy appliances to save time, or whether or not to turn of lights when leaving parts of the house. \r\n\r\nAfter the household tasks have been completed, the user enters an accelerated future simulation. The decisions made by the user are extrapolated over the course of a few years, and the results of those decisions are generated in the virtual environment, visible to the user. The financial cost of the extrapolation is generated in real-time as the simulation proceeds, as well as the CO2 emissions generated in the air around the home.\r\n\r\nThis project was motivated by the countless articles and studies done in the last few decades regarding the environmental and financial burdens of household appliances. This simulation conveys the effects of just a few every-day decisions in a vivid, realistic style.\r\n\r\n### Learning Objective \r\nAfter the VR experience, participants will have a greater deal of empathy toward energy conservation and the effects of CO2 emissions.\r\n\r\n### Assets & Models\r\nHere is a list physical of elements we used to build the scene (with the package and developer if imported):\r\n\r\nAnd here is a list of the auditory elements in the scene:\r\n\r\n### Links\r\n- [YouTube Video] (TODO)\r\n- [Opinion Questionnaire] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uqBGL8rvRCKSuzktO0FOJTAxWjOHm0_2kOBKxWBJF8k/edit?usp=sharing)",
